## Introduction
I started this project to hone my skills in web development and project management. I realize there must be a million sudoku websites out there, but I find the game interesting so I chose to design a web app built around sudoku. My focus is mainly on implementing clean, understandable and efficient code, with an emphasis on readability.

## Technologies
This project uses:  
 * Node
 * React

## Installation
Install using NPM:
```
git clone https://github.com/randywf/sudoku-react.git
cd sudoku-react
npm install
npm start
```

## Future Plans
I plan on integrating this front-end app with a backend database, but I'm still learning how to make them communicate. As of now, I'm focusing on finishing up the front end.

### To-Do List
 - Tests
 - Check for valid solution
 - Load file
 - Plan for back-end integration
 - CSS styling
 - Fixed cells (starting numbers)
